		<h4>Introduction</h4>
		<p>Hi, my name is <strong>Laurien van der Holst</strong>. Now I am 23 years old and I currently live in Breda.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>New York</li> 
					<li>London</li>
					<li>Paris</li>
					<li>Milan</li>
					<li>Istanbul</li>
					<li>Switzerland etc.</li>
				</ul>
			<p>These are a few places where I have lived and worked for the last 3 years.<br>This is because I got the chance when it was 17 to be an international model and work for the big fashion brands.<br>In my spare time I like to cook, bake, watch movies or tv shows and work out.</p>

	<div id="whyIchooseIMEM">
	<h4>Why I choose IMEM</h4>
	<p>I choose to study IMEM because I have been a part of marketing in the media as a model.<br>I was the face
of marketing campaigns as a model in magazines.<br>The marketing, especially on social media for my own
businesses is a big part of the job.<br>Thatâ€™s the way how you get clients attention and show them why they
must work with you.<br>I got more and more interested about marketing and the media world.<br>I would love
to switch from being in the campaigns to designing and being the brains behind the campaigns.</p>
